## Game Architecture

### Common Patterns
- All games follow a similar structure with:
  - Game state management (useState)
  - Score tracking integration
  - Statistics saving to localStorage
  - Responsive design patterns
  - Back navigation to GamesHub

### Integration Points
- Games are dynamically loaded by `GamesHub.jsx`
- Statistics are saved using `utils/helpers.js`
- Animations use `utils/animations.js`
- Consistent styling with CSS custom properties

### Development Guidelines
1. Each game should be a self-contained component
2. Use the helpers utility for score tracking
3. Follow the established CSS patterns for theming
4. Include accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
5. Implement proper game state management
6. Add visual feedback for user actions

## Adding New Games

1. Create new game component in this directory
2. Add corresponding CSS file in `styles/`
3. Update `GamesHub.jsx` to include the new game
4. Add game metadata to `data/games.js`
5. Write tests in `__tests__/` directory
6. Update this README with game details

## Testing Games

Each game should include:
- Unit tests for game logic
- Integration tests for score saving
- Accessibility tests
- Performance tests for animations

## Performance Considerations

- Use React.memo for expensive computations
- Throttle rapid user interactions
- Clean up timers and intervals
- Optimize animations for 60fps
- Consider mobile performance limitations
